# logger - The simplest Python logging out there!

With logger, you can track events that happen when software runs with just one line of code. logger is super easy to use and handles everything for you. Just specify log filename , message that you want to pass ,level(importance which developer ascribes to the event;), and format of logs(which is totally Optional) and the rest is done for you.

# Usage
In the following paragraphs, I am going to describe how you can get and use Scrapeasy for your own projects.

# Getting it

To download logger, either fork this github repo or simply use Pypi via pip.

$ pip install logger

# Using it

logger was programmed with ease-of-use in mind. First, import loggerClass from logger

from logger import loggerClass 

# Print onScreen

it will print the message on console.

loggerClass.WritetoScreen(loggerClass,logging.INFO,"testing...",'%(levelname)s:%(message)s')

--> logging.INFO - level or severity of events they are used to track

--> "testing..." - Message

--> '%(levelname)s:%(message)s' - specify the order, structure, and content of the log message.




it will store the message in logFile.

loggerClass.Writetofile(loggerClass,'sample.log',logging.WARNING,"testing...",'%(asctime)s:%(levelname)s:%(message)s')

--> 'sample.log' - Log Filename 

--> logging.WARNING - level or severity of events they are used to track

--> "testing..." - Message

--> '%(asctime)s:%(levelname)s:%(message)s' - specify the order, structure, and content of the log message.
